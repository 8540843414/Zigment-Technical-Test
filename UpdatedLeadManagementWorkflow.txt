### Updated Lead Management Workflow: Handling Edge Cases

#### Overview
This workflow has been enhanced to address key edge cases: handling incomplete data, ensuring high-value leads are managed effectively, and accommodating leads from different time zones.

#### Workflow Steps

1. **Google Forms (Trigger)**:
   - Captures new lead submissions.

2. **Filter by Zapier (Action)**: Handle Incomplete Data
   - Checks for missing or incomplete fields (e.g., Company Size, Budget, Industry, Urgency). 
   - If fields are missing:
     - Sends an email to the lead asking them to update their details.

3. **Code by Zapier (Action)**: Calculate Lead Score
   - Runs the JavaScript script to compute the lead score.

4. **Filter by Zapier (Action)**: High-Value Leads
   - Filters leads with a score greater than 85 for priority handling.

5. **Slack or Gmail (Action)**: Notify Sales Team
   - Sends a notification with lead details for immediate follow-up.

6. **Google Sheets (Action)**: Save Leads
   - Adds all leads to a Google Sheets database.
   - High-value leads are added to a "Priority Leads" tab.

7. **Formatter by Zapier (Action)**: Handle Time Zones
   - Extracts time zone from the leadâ€™s location or email domain (if available).
   - Uses the "Delay by Zapier" step to schedule actions based on the lead's local business hours.

8. **Gmail (Action)**: Schedule Emails
   - Sends a welcome email or follow-up at the lead's local business hours.

#### Key Updates to Address Edge Cases

1. **Handling Incomplete Data**:
   - Adds a filter to identify incomplete submissions.
   - Sends automated emails to request missing data.

2. **Ensuring High-Value Leads Are Properly Managed**:
   - Filters high-value leads (score > 85).
   - Notifies the sales team for immediate action and flags leads in a "Priority Leads" tab.

3. **Accommodating Different Time Zones**:
   - Extracts time zone data from submission details.
   - Schedules emails and follow-ups at optimal times using "Delay by Zapier."

#### Testing and Validation
- Test incomplete data handling by submitting forms with missing fields.
- Verify high-value leads are notified to the sales team and saved in the "Priority Leads" tab.
- Validate time zone detection and scheduled email delivery based on test lead data.

#### Next Steps
- Deploy the updated Zap and validate its performance with live data.
- Monitor for any new edge cases and iteratively improve the workflow.
